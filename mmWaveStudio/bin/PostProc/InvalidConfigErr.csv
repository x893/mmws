BitVal,	Error
0,	No Error
1,	Frame config has not been programmed.
2,	The chirps selected in the frame config have not been programmed.
4,	The profiles selected in the chirp config (used for the current frame) have not been programmed.
8,	0 samples per real chain have been programmed. Please check the profile config for errors. 
16,	Less than 4096 samples per real chain have been programmed for collection through LVDS. HSDC Pro will only collect a mininmum of 4096 samples. Please increase the number of frames.
32,	More than 32000000 samples per real chain have been programmed for collection through LVDS. HSDC Pro has only 500MB of RAM, and cannot collect any more than 32000000 samples. 
64,	Frame time is greater than the frame periodicity
128,	LVDS rate is lesser than ADC rate. 
256,	A single frame with a size (in real samples per real chain) that is not a multiple of 4096 has been programmed. Please increase the number of frames so that at least two frames are collected.
512, 	Less than 8192 samples per real chain have been programmed for collection through LVDS. HSDC Pro will only collect a mininmum of 8192 samples. Please increase the number of frames.
